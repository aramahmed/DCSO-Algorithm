this code is an implementation of a research work which is submitted to a journal and it is in the process of revision
title of the research work: Dynamic Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Backboard Wiring Problem



in order to reproduce the results presented in the paper, you should:
 * open the "main.m" file
 * uncomment the first "for loop" to run the benchmark functions, and then specify the function name.
 * uncomment the second "for loop" to run the QAP dataset, and then specify the fobj.


- Xpl and Xpt: will return the percentage of exploration and exploitation respectively
- Best_score = will return the fitness value of the global best solution after Max_iteration is reached.
- Best_pos = will return the position of the global best solution after Max_iteration is reached.

in the manuscript, for each test function or dataset the algorithm has been experimented 30 independent runs and their average values are inserted into the tables.
