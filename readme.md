### in order to reproduce the results presented in the paper, you should:
 1. open the "main.m" file
 2. uncomment the first "for loop" to run the benchmark functions, and then specify the function name.
 3. uncomment the second "for loop" to run the QAP dataset, and then specify the fobj.


- Xpl and Xpt: will return the percentage of exploration and exploitation respectively
- Best_score = will return the fitness value of the global best solution after Max_iteration is reached.
- Best_pos = will return the position of the global best solution after Max_iteration is reached.

in the manuscript, for each test function or dataset the algorithm has been experimented 30 independent runs and their average values are inserted into the tables.
